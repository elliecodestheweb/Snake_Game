Simple game of Snake built at the Girls in Tech Learn to Code workshop 5/18/19.

Welcome to this repo~
This is a game of Snake built at a workshop hosted by San Diego Girls in Tech and LEARN Academy at Amazon HQ on May 18, 2019.
Built using JavaScript and a tutorial to help beginners get the hang of basic JavaScript. 
I will update this README to include a link to the tutorial in case anyone else wants to try it!
